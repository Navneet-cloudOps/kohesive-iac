// TODO:  things to think about

// Some services must be in the same region as others that connect
// Some services are only available in some regions

// Some services are custom steps, like database migration

// is there machine readable version of https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/
// this might cover it: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-price-list-api/
// which also includes pricing.  we could rough out calculate stack prices
// more here: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/price-changes.html
// can notify on changes that affect a previously deployed stack as well

// Ruby API includes JSON description of all AWS SDK api's, might be useful https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/tree/master/aws-sdk-core/apis
// the Java JDK has `resouce/models` in some (or all?) of the SDK's that looks like it might be used for codegen (https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/tree/master/aws-java-sdk-code-generator)
// bunch of models here as well: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/tree/master/aws-java-sdk-models/src/main/resources/models

// some python project out there scanned cloud format docs to try and build JSON schema, using this source http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-reference.html

// someone made a scala DSL type thing to generate cloud formation templates
